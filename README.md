# Predicting Loan Payback Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project builds and evaluates supervised machine learning models to predict whether a borrower will repay a loan.

The objective was to identify key financial indicators that influence loan repayment risk and develop predictive models to support data-driven lending decisions.

## Business Problem

Financial institutions must assess borrower risk before approving loans. Incorrect risk assessment can lead to financial losses.

This project applies machine learning classification techniques to:

- Predict loan repayment likelihood
- Identify high-risk borrowers
- Support decision-making in credit risk analysis

---

## Dataset

- Kaggle financial dataset
- Contains borrower demographic and financial features
- Target variable: Loan repayment status

---

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## Modeling Approach

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
   - Handled missing values
   - Feature engineering
   - Encoding categorical variables

2. Model Development
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost (if used)

3. Model Evaluation
   - Accuracy
   - Precision / Recall
   - Confusion Matrix
   - AUC-ROC

---

## Key Results

The models were evaluated based on classification performance.  
Feature importance analysis identified the most influential financial predictors of repayment risk.
